      <h2>Public Transit Research IQP in Lyon, France</h2>
      <p>
        As part of an ongoing research project with my university, WPI, I am
        currently spending the summer in Lyon, France researching the public
        transit system. My team and I are collecting data on the public transit
        system in Lyon and using it to produce a report on the system's
        efficiency and effectiveness. We are also working on a way to visualize
        the data we've collected. All the code used to visualize the data is
        written in Python and will be available on my
        <a href="https://github.com/AldenCutler/LyonE24">GitHub page</a> once
        the project is complete and the repository is made public. Additionally,
        once the project is complete, I will post a link to the report
        <a href="#">here</a>.
      </p>

        As part of the project, I created an interactive map of the city of
        Lyon. The city is divided into 59 "IRIS" zones, which are used by the
        French government to collect demographic data. Each zone represents an
        area with an average population of 2000 people, and is color-coded based
        on the ratio of wheelchair-accessible transit stops to total transit
        stops in the zone. This map is also available
        <a href="https://public.maxmob.sh/lyon/maps/iris_accessibility_map.html"
          >here</a
        >.

        Another map I created as part of the project shows where outages have
        occurred in the Lyon public transit system, overlayed on top of the
        metro lines. From this visualization, we can see that outages are more
        common at the intersections of metro lines and at stops which are also
        regional train stops. This map is available
        <a href="https://public.maxmob.sh/lyon/maps/outages_heatmap.html"
          >here</a
        >.
