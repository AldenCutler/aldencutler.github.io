            As part of an ongoing research project with my university, WPI, I am currently spending the summer in Lyon, France
            researching the public transit system. My team and I are collecting data on the public transit system in Lyon and
            using it to produce a report on the system's efficiency and effectiveness. We are also working on a way to visualize
            the data we've collected. All the code used to visualize the data is written in Python and will be available on my 
            <a href="https://github.com/AldenCutler/LyonE24">GitHub page</a> once the project is complete and the repository is made public.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the project is complete, I will post a link to the report <a href="#">here</a>.
