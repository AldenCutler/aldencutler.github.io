        ChordStorm is a web app made for GoatHacks 2024 that recommends music
        based on the current weather and your listening history. The app was
        built using Flask for the backend, OpenAI's GPT API for the music
        recommendations, and Spotify's API for the user's listening history. If
        you'd like to see the code, you can find it on my
        <a href="https://github.com/AldenCutler/ChordStorm" target="_blank"
          >GitHub</a
        >. We're working on a way to deploy the app so that it can be used by
        anyone, but for now, there is a demo video on the
        <a href="https://devpost.com/software/tunecast-e7n1hg" target="_blank"
          >Devpost page</a
        >, or if you have an OpenAI API key, you can clone the repo and run the
        app locally.
