# To Run

Either:
    1. Run the included queens.exe file. It will ask which methods to test, so you can either run all of them or just one.
    2. Use the command 'make' to compile and run the program.

## Question Answers

For the answers to the questions in the assignment pdf, I've included a file called 'text_answerse.txt' in the folder.

### Proof of Correctness

I used the included examples in the assignment pdf to test my code. For the allSolutions method, I also compared my output
to the known numbers of solutions for n = 1 to 10, which I found on the [OEIS](https://oeis.org/A000170). These numbers are
also available on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) for the eight queens puzzle.
I included proof that my program can get to n = 36 for the firstSolution method and n = 17 for the allSolutions method.
There should be two images in the folder, one for each method. The images are named 'firstSolution.png' and 'allSolutions.png'.
I also copied the console output for both methods into text files, 'firstSolution.txt' and 'allSolutions.txt'.
