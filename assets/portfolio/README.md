# Portfolio

Handshake doesn't let me upload .zip archives to display my portfolio, so the easiest workaround I thought of
was to upload the archive to GitHub and then provide a link to this page in my application on Handshake. To
download my portfolio and look at some of the work I've done in the past, just download the .zip archive in
this folder.
