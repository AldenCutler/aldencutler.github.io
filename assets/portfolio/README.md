# Portfolio

Handshake doesn't let me upload .zip archives to display my portfolio, so the easiest workaround I thought of was to upload the archive to GitHub and then provide a link to this page in my application on Handshake. To download my portfolio and look at some of the work I've done in the past, just download any of the .zip archives in this folder.

## Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering
This contains coursework from my Software Security Design and Analysis class. It covers many different kinds of exploits like stack or heap-based buffer overflows, Ret2LibC, Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), format string vulnerabilities, and other general memory corruption attacks.

## Concurrency (threads and locks)
This is a project written for my Operating Systems class. See its README[https]
